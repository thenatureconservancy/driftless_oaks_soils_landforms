## Integrated Moisture Index

In a mesophication context, oaks might have a competitive advantage over competitors such as red maple when long-term soil moisture is limited (Loftis and McGee 1993). With this in mind, Iverson et al. (1996; also see Iverson et al. 1997) developed the Integrated Moisture Index (IMI), a GIS tool that uses readily available input datasets (e.g., a Digital Elevation Model, DEM) to generate a single number that ranges from 0-100 that captures where soil moisture should be higher:

* where solar radiation is minimized
* where flow accumulation occurs (lower positions on slopes)
* and in soils with higher water storage capacity


## Raster map of the Integrated Moisture Index

Using updated methods kindly shared by Matt Peters (in review, 2025), I calculated the IMI and map the raw data below.  For both the raster and the HUC 12 maps, lower values are hypothesized to be better for oaks.

## Mean Integrated Moisture Index per HUC 12

The map below depicts mean IMI values per HUC 12 watershed as calculated using Zonal Statistics in ArcGIS Pro.
