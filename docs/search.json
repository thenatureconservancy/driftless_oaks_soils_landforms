This data was clipped to the dissolved HUC 12 watersheds boundary shapefile. See R code below for lists of ecosystems and landforms.\nCombined these oak areas with the Landforms dataset developed by The Nature Conservancy’s Center for Resilient Conservation Science. This dataset ‘subdivides landscapes into local topographic units with unique moisture and temperature profiles’ (from the dataset’s webpage linked above).\nExported the attribute table as “evt_landforms_combine.csv”. Ran the code below to append a column that essentially says “yes or no, oak-containing ecosystems occuring on suitable landforms”.\nThis new column was joined back to the combined evt_landform_combine raster.\n\nThe top map on this page was made with the raw raster data.\nFor the HUC 12 map I used the Zonal Statistics as Table tool to get the number of pixels labeled as “1” (i.e., oak containing ecosystem occuring on suitable landforms) per watershed , statistics type = SUM. I then multiplied the SUM by 0.2224 to get acres.\n\n\nCode for identifying oak-containing ecosystems and suitable landforms\nThe code below was run in R to add a new column named “in_y_n” to the evt_landforms_combine.csv data for joining to combined evt_landforms raster.\n\ntarget_evt_names &lt;- c(\n  \"North-Central Interior Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland\",\n  \"North-Central Interior Dry Oak Forest and Woodland\",\n  \"Laurentian-Acadian Northern Pine-(Oak) Forest\",\n  \"Laurentian-Acadian Northern Oak Forest\",\n  \"North-Central Oak Barrens Woodland\",\n  \"Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens\",\n  \"Laurentian Oak Barrens\",\n  \"North-Central Oak Barrens Herbaceous\",\n  \"North-Central Interior Oak Savanna\",\n  \"Southern Interior Low Plateau Dry-Mesic Oak Forest\",\n  \"Northern & Central Native Ruderal Forest\",\n  \"Northern & Central Ruderal Meadow\",\n  \"Northern & Central Ruderal Shrubland\"\n)\n\n# Updated list of acceptable Landforms\ntarget_landforms &lt;- c(\n  \"Steep slope: SW warm\",\n  \"Cliff: SW warm\",\n  \"Flat summit/ridge\",\n  \"Slope crest\",\n  \"Upper flat\",\n  \"Gentle slope\",\n  \"Sideslope SW warm\",\n  \"Lower Slope SW warm\",\n  \"Dry flat\",\n  \"Cove: SW warm\"\n)\n\n# Add the new column based on both conditions\nevt_landforms &lt;- evt_landforms %&gt;%\n  mutate(in_y_n = if_else(EVT_NAME %in% target_evt_names & Landforms %in% target_landforms, 1, 0))\n\nwrite_csv(evt_landforms, file = \"outputs/evt_landforms_to_join.csv\")"
